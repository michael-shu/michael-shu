### 🚀 About Me 

👨‍🎓 I recently graduated NYU with a bachelors degree, majoring in computer science and minoring in data science. I am currently looking for full time roles

💻I'm well versed in web development langauges and frameworks such as Express, React, Vue and NextJS. You can find samples of my work through [basic html/css websites](https://michael-shu.github.io/copyWebsiteAssistanceForward/), my [Champion Mastery Website](https://champion-mastery-op-gg.herokuapp.com/), and my own [portfolio](https://www.michael-shu.com).
